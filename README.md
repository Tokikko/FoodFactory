# FoodFactory
Simple application for listing and searching recipes from mealdb. Was written as an example application for "learning" react native and flexbox for styling. The access key is the default one from mealdb, if by any chance you want to extend this you should visit their site and get a real key. https://www.themealdb.com/api.php
